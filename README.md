# DOSAttackusingNS2
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. DoS attacks accomplish this by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash. To execute a simple DoS attack, the attacker selects a target (typically a server from the client/server architecture) and systematically sends service requests to them. As these requests are fake, the attacker can simply ignore the server responses.
